üîê 1. Security

[ ] All forms include {% csrf_token %}.

[ ] Sensitive views use @login_required or proper permission checks.

[ ] No use of eval(), exec(), or unsafe deserialization.

‚ö° 2. Performance

[ ] Checked for N+1 queries (with django-debug-toolbar).

[ ] Use select_related / prefetch_related where needed.

[ ] Expensive queries use caching (Redis, memcached).

[ ] Loops with .count() / .exists() replaced with ORM annotate().

[ ] High-volume inserts/updates use .bulk_create() / .bulk_update().

[ ] Frequently queried fields have proper DB indexes.

üõ† 3. Maintainability

[ ] Functions/methods < 50 lines, well-named and modular.

[ ] No unused imports, dead code, or AI ‚Äúhallucinated‚Äù stubs.

[ ] Code follows DRY (no unnecessary duplication).

[ ] Business logic separated (views ‚â† business ‚â† models).

[ ] Clear docstrings explaining why, not just what.

üì¶ 5. Dependencies

[ ] No outdated or insecure packages (pip-audit, safety check).

[ ] Only necessary libraries included (no AI-added bloat).

[ ] Licenses checked (no GPL unless project allows it).


üìä 6. Monitoring & Deployment

[ ] Logging uses logging module (no print in production).

[ ] Errors logged at proper levels (ERROR, WARNING).
